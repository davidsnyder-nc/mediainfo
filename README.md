# Media Tracker

**Media Tracker** is a Flask-based application that unifies your home media APIs (Plex, Sonarr, and more) into a single, modern API and dashboard.  
It acts as a "one API to rule them all," aggregating, normalizing, and exposing your media data through a single endpoint and a beautiful web interface.

## Why Media Tracker?

- **One API, One Dashboard:**  
  No more juggling multiple apps and endpoints. Media Tracker collects, merges, and presents all your media data in one place.
- **Meta-API:**  
  Query your entire media ecosystem (Plex, Sonarr, etc.) through a single, consistent API.
- **Customizable Reports:**  
  Generate daily/weekly reports, text files, and more‚Äîlocally or to GitHub.
- **Modern Dashboard:**  
  See your entire media universe at a glance: movies, TV shows, schedules, stats, and more.

- Customizable format for movies, TV shows, and schedule.
- Optionally upload reports to GitHub.

---

## Security & Best Practices

- **Never commit your `config.json` or API keys to git.**
- `.gitignore` is pre-configured to exclude sensitive files.
- Use environment variables for secrets if deploying to production.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all media servers are accessible from the app server.
- Verify API keys and tokens are correct.
- Check logs for detailed error messages.
- For GitHub uploads, ensure your token has `repo` scope.
